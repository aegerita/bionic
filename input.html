      TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE
    </h2>
<p>
      A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to
      understand his work.
    </p>
<p>
      Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working and
      deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five
      children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings in
      reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious
      character.
    </p>
<p>
      Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the final
      examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had already
      begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”
     </p>
<p>
      This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and was
      received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself instantly
      something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open
      before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he was arrested.
    </p>
<p>
      Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky
      was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier
      and Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against the
      censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing of
      the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas I. (that “stern
      and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was enough, and he was
      condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment he was with
      twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing
      to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped words over our
      heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned
      to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes, to suffer
      execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few
      minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and I
      contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid
      them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound, brought
      back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared us our
      lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.
    </p>
<p>
      One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and
      never regained his sanity.
    </p>
<p>
      The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on
      Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to
      accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing in
      his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings. He
      describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty
      of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal servitude,
      spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where he began the
      “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary battalion.
    </p>
<p>
      He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest and
      this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he
      suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times a
      year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was
      allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal—“Vremya,” which
      was forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he
      lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty,
      yet he took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started
      another journal—“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also
      prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was
      dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is
      said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were
      much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.
    </p>
<p>
      In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to
      Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary demonstrations of
      love and honour.
    </p>
<p>
      A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a vast
      multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a king.”
       He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.
    </p>
<p>
      In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling
      inspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and
      our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than
      we have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart
      which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other gifts
      came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he became
      great.”

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
<p>
      On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the
      garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in
      hesitation, towards K. bridge.
    </p>
<p>
      He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His
      garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like
      a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,
      dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went
      out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood
      open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened
      feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt
      to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
    </p>
<p>
      This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but
      for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,
      verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself,
      and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his
      landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties
      of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up
      attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do
      so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to
      be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial,
      irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and
      complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie—no,
      rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out
      unseen.
    </p>
<p>
      This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely
      aware of his fears.
    </p>
<p>
      “I want to attempt a thing <i>like that</i> and am frightened by these
      trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s
      hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be
      interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step,
      uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking too much.
      It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter
      because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this last month, lying for
      days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I
      going there now? Am I capable of <i>that</i>? Is <i>that</i> serious? It
      is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything!
      Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”
     </p>
<p>
      The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and
      the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special
      Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in
      summer—all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought
      nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are
      particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom
      he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting
      misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed
      for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way,
      exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built,
      with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep
      thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he
      walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe
      it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of
      talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these moments he
      would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that
      he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food.
    </p>
<p>
      He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would
      have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter
      of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created
      surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of
      establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and
      working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart
      of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets that no
      figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was such
      accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in
      spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all
      in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or
      with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any
      time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being
      taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly
      shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German hatter” bawling at the
      top of his voice and pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly
      and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat from
      Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and
      bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion. Not
      shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      “I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst of
      all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil
      the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd and that
      makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of
      old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it
      would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What matters is
      that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue. For this
      business one should be as little conspicuous as possible.... Trifles,
      trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such trifles that always ruin
      everything....”
     </p>
<p>
      He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate
      of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted
      them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no faith
      in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but
      daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon them
      differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own
      impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this
      “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still did not
      realise this himself. He was positively going now for a “rehearsal” of his
      project, and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent.
    </p>
<p>
      With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house
      which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the
      street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by
      working people of all kinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of
      sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.
      There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the
      two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on
      the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and at
      once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the
      staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar
      with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings: in
      such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
    </p>
<p>
      “If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that I
      were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he
      reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters
      who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat
      had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his family.
      This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase
      would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good thing anyway,”
       he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The
      bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper.
      The little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that. He
      had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to
      remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him.... He started,
      his nerves were terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door
      was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor with evident
      distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her little eyes,
      glittering in the darkness. But, seeing a number of people on the landing,
      she grew bolder, and opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the
      dark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman
      stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a
      diminutive, withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and
      a sharp little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly
      smeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long
      neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,
      and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy
      fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every
      instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar
      expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.
    </p>
<p>
      “Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made
      haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more
      polite.
    </p>
<p>
      “I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the old
      woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.
    </p>
<p>
      “And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a
      little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps
      she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other time,”
       he thought with an uneasy feeling.
    </p>
<p>
      The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side, and
      pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass in
      front of her:
    </p>
<p>
      “Step in, my good sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the
      walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted
      up at that moment by the setting sun.
    </p>
<p>
      “So the sun will shine like this <i>then</i> too!” flashed as it were by
      chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned
      everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember
      its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The furniture,
      all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent
      wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a
      looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and
      two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German
      damsels with birds in their hands—that was all. In the corner a
      light was burning before a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the
      floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.
    </p>
<p>
      “Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust to
      be seen in the whole flat.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such
      cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at
      the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which
      stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never
      looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.
    </p>
<p>
      “What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room and,
      as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the
      face.
    </p>
<p>
      “I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket an
      old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a
      globe; the chain was of steel.
    </p>
<p>
      “But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day before
      yesterday.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your
      pledge at once.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”
     </p>
<p>
      “You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything. I
      gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite
      new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I
      shall be getting some money soon.”
     </p>
<p>
      “A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”
     </p>
<p>
      “A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.
    </p>

<p>
      “That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna and
      Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the
      kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but
      abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon
      Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’
      They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They
      began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed to
      get together the money for a decent outfit—eleven roubles, fifty
      copecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts—most magnificent,
      a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and a
      half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina
      Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—soup and salt meat with
      horse radish—which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not
      any dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were
      going on a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened
      herself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a clean
      collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different person,
      she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling, had only
      helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me to come
      and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do you hear,
      do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think:
      though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our
      landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not resist then
      asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting, whispering
      together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving
      a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his excellency and his
      excellency himself came out to him, made all the others wait and led
      Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study.’ Do you
      hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering
      your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite of your propensity to that
      foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we’ve got on
      badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you hear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely
      now on your word as a gentleman.’ And all that, let me tell you, she has
      simply made up for herself, and not simply out of wantonness, for the sake
      of bragging; no, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her
      own fancies, upon my word she does! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I
      don’t blame her!... Six days ago when I brought her my first earnings in
      full—twenty-three roubles forty copecks altogether—she called
      me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she, ‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by
      ourselves, you understand? You would not think me a beauty, you would not
      think much of me as a husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek,
      ‘my little poppet,’ said she.”
     </p>
<p>
      Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began to
      twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded appearance
      of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and
      yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener.
      Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation. He felt vexed
      that he had come here.
    </p>
<p>
      “Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself—“Oh,
      sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to
      others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the
      trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.
      For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life
      and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would
      arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should
      give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and
      restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more.... Quite
      excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of
      start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on the
      very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five days
      ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night, I
      stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was left of
      my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look at me, all of
      you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are looking for me
      there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform is lying in a
      tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the garments I have
      on... and it’s the end of everything!”
     </p>
<p>
      Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed
      his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute
      later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and
      affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:
    </p>
<p>
      “This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!
      He-he-he!”
     </p>
<p>
      “You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he
      shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
    </p>
<p>
      “This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,
      addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave me
      with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said nothing,
      she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up yonder...
      they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them, they don’t
      blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t blame! Thirty
      copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do you think, my dear
      sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It costs money, that
      smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you understand? And
      there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things; petticoats, starched
      ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to
      step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you understand what all
      that smartness means? And here I, her own father, here I took thirty
      copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking it! And I have
      already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like me, eh? Are you
      sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? He-he-he!”
     </p>
<p>
      He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was
      empty.
    </p>
<p>
      “What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again
      near them.
    </p>
<p>
      Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths
      came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard
      nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government
      clerk.
    </p>
<p>
      “To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,
      standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only waiting
      for that question.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I
      ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me, oh
      judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be
      crucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...
      Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to
      me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and
      tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity us
      Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He
      is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day and He will ask:
      ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive
      step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is the daughter
      who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father, undismayed by
      his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have already forgiven
      thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins which are many are
      forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he will forgive my Sonia,
      He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my heart when I was with her
      just now! And He will judge and will forgive all, the good and the evil,
      the wise and the meek.... And when He has done with all of them, then He
      will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’ He will say, ‘Come forth ye
      drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame!’
      And we shall all come forth, without shame and shall stand before him. And
      He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made in the Image of the Beast and
      with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the wise ones and those of
      understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?’ And He
      will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye wise, this is why I receive
      them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be
      worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall
      down before him... and we shall weep... and we shall understand all
      things! Then we shall understand all!... and all will understand, Katerina
      Ivanovna even... she will understand.... Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he
      sank down on the bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one,
      apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought. His
      words had created a certain impression; there was a moment of silence; but
      soon laughter and oaths were heard again.
    </p>
<p>
      “That’s his notion!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Talked himself silly!”
     </p>
<p>
      “A fine clerk he is!”
     </p>
<p>
      And so on, and so on.
    </p>
<p>
      “Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and
      addressing Raskolnikov—“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking
      into the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna—time I did.”
     </p>
<p>
      Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help
      him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and
      leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred paces to
      go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as
      they drew nearer the house.
    </p>
<p>
      “It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in agitation—“and
      that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair matter! Bother my
      hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if she does begin
      pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her eyes I am afraid
      of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me... and her
      breathing too.... Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe...
      when they are excited? I am frightened of the children’s crying, too....
      For if Sonia has not taken them food... I don’t know what’s happened! I
      don’t know! But blows I am not afraid of.... Know, sir, that such blows
      are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. In fact I can’t get on
      without it.... It’s better so. Let her strike me, it relieves her heart...
      it’s better so... There is the house. The house of Kozel, the
      cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do. Lead the way!”
     </p>
<p>
      They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase got
      darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock and
      although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite
      dark at the top of the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
      A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very
      poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end; the
      whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,
      littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments. Across
      the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it probably was
      the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa
      covered with American leather, full of holes, before which stood an old
      deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge of the table
      stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It appeared that
      the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but their room
      was practically a passage. The door leading to the other rooms, or rather
      cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was divided stood half
      open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter within. People seemed to
      be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words of the most unceremonious
      kind flew out from time to time.
    </p>
<p>
      Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,
      slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
      hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down in
      her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were
      parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes glittered
      as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And that
      consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the
      candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to
      Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for
      Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.
      She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room was
      close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the
      staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner
      rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not
      close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting
      curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older stood
      crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a beating.
      Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin
      and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare
      shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees. Her arm, as thin
      as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was trying to comfort him,
      whispering something to him, and doing all she could to keep him from
      whimpering again. At the same time her large dark eyes, which looked
      larger still from the thinness of her frightened face, were watching her
      mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the door, but dropped on his
      knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman
      seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming to herself for
      a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for. But evidently she
      decided that he was going into the next room, as he had to pass through
      hers to get there. Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards the
      outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband
      on his knees in the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the
      monster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! And
      your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the
      money! Speak!”
     </p>
<p>
      And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently held
      up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.
    </p>
<p>
      “Where is the money?” she cried—“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it
      all? There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury
      she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov
      seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.
    </p>
<p>
      “And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a positive
      con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and fro by his
      hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead. The child asleep
      on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the corner losing all
      control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent
      terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was shaking like a leaf.
    </p>
<p>
      “He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in despair—“and
      his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”—and wringing her
      hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life! And you, are you
      not ashamed?”—she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov—“from
      the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have been drinking with
      him, too! Go away!”
     </p>
<p>
      The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door
      was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse
      laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust
      themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in dressing
      gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of them with
      cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when Marmeladov,
      dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation to him. They
      even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was
      heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst
      them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the
      hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse
      abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out, Raskolnikov had
      time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the coppers he had
      received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them
      unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed his mind and
      would have gone back.
    </p>
<p>
      “What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia
      and I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to take
      it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he dismissed
      it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging. “Sonia wants
      pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he laughed
      malignantly—“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia
      herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting big
      game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust
      to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug
      there! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most of
      it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to
      everything, the scoundrel!”
     </p>
<p>
      He sank into thought.
    </p>
<p>
      “And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.
      “What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the whole
      race of mankind—then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial
      terrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed Dounia,
      looking uneasily at Zossimov.
    </p>
<p>
      “There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that
      sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the
      slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we must draw
      a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among dozens—perhaps
      hundreds of thousands—hardly one is to be met with.”
     </p>
<p>
      At the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on his
      favourite subject, everyone frowned.
    </p>
<p>
      Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a
      strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!” Razumihin
      cried hastily.
    </p>
<p>
      “What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with blood
      helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an
      unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave away
      all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s a widow
      now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children, starving...
      nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps you’d have
      given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to do it I admit,
      especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself. To help others one
      must have the right to do it, or else <i>Crevez, chiens, si vous n’êtes
      pas contents</i>.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t it, Dounia?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.
    </p>
<p>
      “Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with
      hatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....
      Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a
      line you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,
      maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added
      irritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg
      your forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.
    </p>
<p>
      “That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”
       said his mother, delighted.
    </p>
<p>
      “Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.
    </p>
<p>
      A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this
      conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the
      forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
    </p>
<p>
      “It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking to
      himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria Alexandrovna
      was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through his
      mind.
    </p>
<p>
      “Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
      suddenly blurted out.
    </p>
<p>
      “What Marfa Petrovna?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, mercy on us—Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much
      about her.”
     </p>
<p>
      “A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused himself
      suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered hurriedly,
      encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending you that
      letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been the cause
      of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.
    </p>
<p>
      “Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very
      patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their married
      life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All of a
      sudden he seems to have lost patience.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven
      years? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia
      answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into
      thought.
    </p>
<p>
      “That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on
      hurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed
      to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used to drive to
      the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am told....”
     </p>
<p>
      “After the beating?”
     </p>
<p>
      “That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not to
      be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was
      undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and
      she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got
      into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”
     </p>
<p>
      “I should think so,” said Zossimov.
    </p>
<p>
      “And did he beat her badly?”
     </p>
<p>
      “What does that matter!” put in Dounia.
    </p>
<p>
      “H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,” said
      Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria
      Alexandrovna.
    </p>
<p>
      “Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.
    </p>
<p>
      “That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at her
      brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the
      stairs.”
     </p>
<p>
      His face worked, as though in convulsion.
    </p>
<p>
      “Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya.... Why
      did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, overwhelmed—“You
      see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should
      meet, how we should talk over everything together.... And I was so happy,
      I did not notice the journey! But what am I saying? I am happy now.... You
      should not, Dounia.... I am happy now—simply in seeing you,
      Rodya....”
     </p>
<p>
      “Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but pressing
      her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”
     </p>
<p>
      As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned
      pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly
      chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him
      that he had just told a fearful lie—that he would never now be able
      to speak freely of everything—that he would never again be able to
      <i>speak</i> of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such
      that for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and
      not looking at anyone walked towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
      “What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.
    </p>
<p>
      He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were all
      looking at him in perplexity.
    </p>
<p>
      “But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite
      unexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?
      Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
      Come, anything!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again,”
       said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.
    </p>
<p>
      “What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly laughed.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning
      to think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time for
      me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made his
      bows, and went out.
    </p>
<p>
      “What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov began,
      suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he had not
      shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my illness.... I
      believe I have met him somewhere——... And this is a good man,
      too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked her; and
      suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
    </p>
<p>
      “Very much,” answered Dounia.
    </p>
<p>
      “Foo!—what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible
      confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled
      faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.
    </p>
<p>
      “Where are you off to?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I must go.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.
      What’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,
      Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.
    </p>
<p>
      “And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
    </p>
<p>
      “A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I like that sort,” said Dounia.
    </p>
<p>
      “So it is not a present from her <i>fiancé</i>,” thought Razumihin, and
      was unreasonably delighted.
    </p>
<p>
      “I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”
     </p>
<p>
      “A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get
      married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted by
      the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.
    </p>
<p>
      “Oh, yes, my dear.”
     </p>
<p>
      Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.
    </p>
<p>
      “H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was
      such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.
      “Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always
      dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began
      talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very well. She
      was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me to her then—I
      think it was because she was always ill. If she had been lame or
      hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he smiled
      dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.
    </p>
<p>
      He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did not
      understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up, went up
      to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.
    </p>
<p>
      “You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.
    </p>
<p>
      “Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as it
      were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything happening
      here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them. “You, now...
      I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away... but, goodness
      knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of asking about it?”
       he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell into dreamy silence
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      “What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said
      Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I am
      sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy.”
     </p>
<p>
      “My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great deal
      to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though, what a
      strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing strangely.
    </p>
<p>
      A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister, with
      him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation, in
      face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything, would
      have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent matter
      which must be settled one way or the other that day—so he had
      decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of
      escape.
    </p>
<p>
      “Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your
      pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that I
      do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a
      scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease at
      once to look on you as a sister.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
      cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a scoundrel? I can’t bear
      it. You said the same yesterday.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all this
      there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night, and found out
      the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am sacrificing myself
      to someone and for someone. That is not the case at all. I am simply
      marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for me. Though, of
      course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to my family. But
      that is not the chief motive for my decision....”
     </p>
<p>
      “She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.
      “Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too
      haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,
      how I... hate them all!”
     </p>
<p>
      “In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of
      two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of me,
      so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,
      flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      “All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.
    </p>
<p>
      “Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s
      courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too
      well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing
      again?”
     </p>
<p>
      “And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are
      intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your
      own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked
      with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you
      are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure. “I
      would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks
      highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly convinced that I
      can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing proof of it this very
      day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as you say! And even if you
      were right, if I really had determined on a vile action, is it not
      merciless on your part to speak to me like that? Why do you demand of me a
      heroism that perhaps you have not either? It is despotism; it is tyranny.
      If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I am not committing a murder. Why
      do you look at me like that? Why are you so pale? Rodya, darling, what’s
      the matter?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
    </p>
<p>
      “No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness—not fainting.
      You have fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In
      what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,
      and that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.
    </p>
<p>
      With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He took
      it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked with a
      sort of wonder at Dounia.
    </p>
<p>
      “It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What am
      I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”
     </p>
<p>
      He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for some
      time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at last, still
      with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then, slowly and
      attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice. Pulcheria
      Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something
      particular.
    </p>
<p>
      “What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter to
      his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a
      business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and
      yet he writes such an uneducated letter.”
     </p>
<p>
      They all started. They had expected something quite different.
    </p>
<p>
      “But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.
    </p>
<p>
      “Have you read it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes.”
     </p>
<p>
      “We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria
      Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
    </p>
<p>
      “That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal documents
      are written like that to this day.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Legal? Yes, it’s just legal—business language—not so very
      uneducated, and not quite educated—business language!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
      education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya
      Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to be
      offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the
      letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to
      annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style
      occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There is
      one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and plainly,
      and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I am
      present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you
      both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning you to
      Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an expression
      from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had written it,
      or Zossimov, or one of us?”
     </p>
<p>
      “N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it was
      too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill in
      writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect, indeed...”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he
      intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression in
      the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I gave
      the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with
      trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay for
      the funeral, and not to the daughter—a young woman, as he writes, of
      notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my life)—but
      to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander me and to
      raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal jargon, that
      is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve
      eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, intelligence
      is not enough. It all shows the man and... I don’t think he has a great
      esteem for you. I tell you this simply to warn you, because I sincerely
      wish for your good...”
     </p>
<p>
      Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only awaiting
      the evening.
    </p>
<p>
      “Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was
      more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his talk.
    </p>
<p>
      “What decision?”
     </p>
<p>
      “You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this
      evening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?”
     </p>
<p>
      “That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are
      not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is
      not offended. I will do what you think best,” he added, drily.
    </p>
<p>
      “Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria
      Alexandrovna hastened to declare.
    </p>
<p>
      “I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at
      this interview,” said Dounia. “Will you come?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said,
      addressing Razumihin. “Mother, I am inviting him, too.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,” added Pulcheria
      Alexandrovna, “so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like
      concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr
      Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!”

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<p>
      At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into
      the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with
      surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise her.
      It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for the
      first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such a
      dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she was
      a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed, almost like
      a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but somewhat
      frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor dress, and
      had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a parasol.
      Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so much
      embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child.
      She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said Raskolnikov,
      extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once recollected
      that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter of “some young
      woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been protesting against
      Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for
      the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He remembered, too, that
      he had not protested against the expression “of notorious behaviour.” All
      this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain, but looking at her
      more intently, he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that
      he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she made a movement to retreat in
      terror, it sent a pang to his heart.
    </p>
<p>
      “I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her
      stop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna. Allow
      me—not there. Sit here....”
     </p>
<p>
      At Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of
      Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to
      enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where
      Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him as a
      bed, was too <i>familiar</i> a place, he hurriedly motioned her to
      Razumihin’s chair.
    </p>
<p>
      “You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.
    </p>
<p>
      Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the two
      ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could
      sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened that she
      hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov.
    </p>
<p>
      “I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she
      began falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to
      send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in
      the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her... to do
      her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and ceased
      speaking.
    </p>
<p>
      “I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He, too,
      stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence. “Please
      sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are perhaps in a
      hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and he drew up a
      chair for her.
    </p>
<p>
      Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened
      look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face
      flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.
    </p>

<p>
      “I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said
      thoughtfully. “To her heart I confided much of what has since been so
      hideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was as
      much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great point
      is that everything now is going to be different, is going to be broken in
      two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection. “Everything,
      everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself? They say it is
      necessary for me to suffer! What’s the object of these senseless
      sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I am crushed
      by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years’ penal
      servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I consenting to
      that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood looking at the
      Neva at daybreak to-day!”
     </p>
<p>
      At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him. She
      walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him
      again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for the last
      time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him, he motioned
      her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the corner
      abruptly.
    </p>
<p>
      “I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a moment
      later of his angry gesture to Dounia. “But why are they so fond of me if I
      don’t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved me and I too
      had never loved anyone! <i>Nothing of all this would have happened.</i>
      But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that I
      shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that I am a
      criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are sending me there
      for, that’s what they want. Look at them running to and fro about the
      streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse
      still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be wild with righteous
      indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!”
     </p>
<p>
      He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could be
      humbled before all of them, indiscriminately—humbled by conviction.
      And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual
      bondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should he
      live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be so? It
      was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question
      since the previous evening, but still he went.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
<p>
      When he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day Sonia
      had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with
      her. She had come to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s words
      that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conversation and tears of the
      two girls, and how friendly they became. Dounia gained one comfort at
      least from that interview, that her brother would not be alone. He had
      gone to her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her for
      human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with him wherever fate
      might send him. Dounia did not ask, but she knew it was so. She looked at
      Sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it.
      Sonia was almost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary,
      hardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image when she had
      bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in
      Raskolnikov’s room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions
      of her life.
    </p>
<p>
      Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her brother’s
      room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come there first.
      When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his
      committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day
      trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both were less
      anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each thought of
      nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day
      before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives—Siberia or... Besides
      she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
    </p>
<p>
      “Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to
      make him live?” she thought at last in despair.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking
      intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the
      unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to feel
      sure of his death—he walked into the room.
    </p>
<p>
      She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned
      pale.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It
      was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened now
      it’s come to that?”
     </p>
<p>
      Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold
      shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the
      words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid
      meeting her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      “You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one
      fact.... But it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it. But do
      you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces
      will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid questions,
      which I shall have to answer—they’ll point their fingers at me....
      Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I’d rather go
      to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise him, what a
      sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become too irritable of
      late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because
      she turned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! Ah!
      what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?”
     </p>
<p>
      He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third
      storey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though the
      fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time left for
      consideration.
    </p>
<p>
      Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral
      stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and the
      same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been here
      since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they
      moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to collect himself,
      so as to enter <i>like a man</i>. “But why? what for?” he wondered,
      reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it make? The
      more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the figure of the
      “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him?
      Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he turn back
      and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings? At least then it would be
      done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive lieutenant”! If he must drink
      it, drink it off at once.
    </p>
<p>
      Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office. There
      were very few people in it this time—only a house porter and a
      peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.
      Raskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”
       passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was
      settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was
      seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.
    </p>
<p>
      “No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.
    </p>
<p>
      “Whom do you want?”
     </p>
<p>
      “A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the
      Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I’ve forgotten! ‘At your
      service!’” a familiar voice cried suddenly.
    </p>
<p>
      Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He had
      just come in from the third room. “It is the hand of fate,” thought
      Raskolnikov. “Why is he here?”
     </p>
<p>
      “You’ve come to see us? What about?” cried Ilya Petrovitch. He was
      obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated.
      “If it’s on business you are rather early.[*] It’s only a chance that I am
      here... however I’ll do what I can. I must admit, I... what is it, what is
      it? Excuse me....”
     </p>
<p class="footnote">
     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the
     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for
     coming too late.—TRANSLATOR.
</p>
<p>
      “Raskolnikov.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? Don’t think I
      am like that... Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodionovitch, that’s it, isn’t
      it?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Rodion Romanovitch.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I made
      many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve been genuinely grieved since
      that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me afterwards
      that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and so to say the
      first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific man does not begin
      by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have the greatest respect
      for literature, in my wife it’s a genuine passion! Literature and art! If
      only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be gained by talents,
      learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat—well, what does a hat
      matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what’s under the
      hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even meaning to come and
      apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d... But I am forgetting to ask
      you, is there anything you want really? I hear your family have come?”
     </p>
<p>
      Raskolnikov repeated his statement.

      She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken ill
      again. But she was so happy—and so unexpectedly happy—that she
      was almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, <i>only</i> seven
      years! At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both
      ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did
      not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he
      would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving,
      great suffering.
    </p>
<p>
      But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the gradual
      renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing
      from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.
      That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.
